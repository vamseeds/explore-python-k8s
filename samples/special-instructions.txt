If jenkins is exposed on http url (in my case via eks and elb of aws) you will get 403 error
"No valid crumb was included in the request"
Vist <jenkinsUrl>/crumbIssuer/api/json url on browser 1-2times (Visit this repeatedly until below step is completed)
and try to login
Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> CSRF Protection -> Crumb Issuer -> Check on Enable proxy compatibility -> Save

Checking Enable proxy compatibility will solve that problem

Reason for 403 :
"""
Some HTTP proxies filter out information that the default crumb issuer uses to calculate the nonce value. If an HTTP proxy sits between your browser client and your Jenkins server and you receive a 403 response when submitting a form to Jenkins, checking this option may help. Using this option makes the nonce value easier to forge.
